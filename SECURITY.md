# Security Policy

## Overview

Security is a top priority for the OBS Background Filter plugin. This document outlines our security practices, known issues, and how to report vulnerabilities.

## üîí Security Features

### Implemented Protections

‚úÖ **Path Validation** - Prevents directory traversal attacks (CVE-2025-51480 mitigation)
‚úÖ **SHA-256 Checksum Verification** - Validates model file integrity
‚úÖ **Configuration Validation** - Sanitizes all user input
‚úÖ **Limited Graph Optimization** - Reduces ONNX Runtime attack surface
‚úÖ **Whitelist-based Path Access** - Only allows models from trusted directories
‚úÖ **File Type Validation** - Verifies ONNX file format
‚úÖ **Size Limits** - Prevents resource exhaustion attacks
‚úÖ **No Network Access** - Plugin operates entirely offline

### Architecture Security

- **Memory Safety**: Modern C++17 with RAII and smart pointers
- **No Arbitrary Code Execution**: Models run in ONNX Runtime sandbox
- **Minimal Privileges**: User-level installation (no root required)
- **Thread Safety**: Mutex-protected critical sections
- **Bounds Checking**: All array accesses validated

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Risks

###

 **CRITICAL: Untrusted Models**

**Risk Level**: üî¥ **CRITICAL**

Loading ONNX models from untrusted sources can lead to:
- Arbitrary code execution through ONNX Runtime vulnerabilities
- Path traversal attacks (CVE-2025-51480)
- Memory corruption exploits
- System compromise

**Mitigation**:
1. ‚úÖ **ONLY** download models from official sources
2. ‚úÖ **ALWAYS** verify SHA-256 checksums
3. ‚úÖ Never load models from untrusted users or websites
4. ‚úÖ Use models listed in our verified MODELS.md

### **ONNX Runtime Vulnerabilities**

**Known CVEs**:
- CVE-2024-37032: Memory access violation in graph optimization
- CVE-2025-51480: Path traversal in external data loading

**Our Mitigations**:
- Use `ORT_ENABLE_BASIC` optimization (not `ORT_ENABLE_ALL`)
- Path validation before model loading
- Regular dependency updates

### **OBS Plugin Permissions**

OBS plugins run with full access to:
- Video streams
- Audio streams
- System resources
- User files

**User Responsibility**:
- Only install plugins from trusted sources
- Verify plugin signatures when available
- Review source code before compiling

## üõ°Ô∏è Best Practices

### For Users

#### Safe Model Usage

```bash
# ‚úÖ CORRECT: Download from official source with verification
wget https://github.com/danielgatis/rembg/releases/download/v0.0.0/u2net.onnx
echo "EXPECTED_SHA256  u2net.onnx" | sha256sum -c

# ‚ùå WRONG: Download from untrusted source
# wget http://random-website.com/model.onnx  # DON'T DO THIS!
```

#### Verify Checksums

Always verify model checksums before use:

```bash
# Calculate checksum
sha256sum u2net.onnx

# Compare with known-good hash from MODELS.md
# If they don't match, DO NOT use the model!
```

#### Safe Installation

```bash
# ‚úÖ CORRECT: Build from official repository
git clone https://github.com/brickjawn/OBS-background-filter.git
cd OBS-background-filter
# Verify git tags/signatures
./scripts/build.sh

# ‚ùå WRONG: Download random binary
# DO NOT download .so files from untrusted sources!
```

### For Developers

#### Code Review Checklist

When modifying security-critical code:

- [ ] Validate all file paths
- [ ] Check array bounds
- [ ] Sanitize user input
- [ ] Use const correctness
- [ ] Avoid raw pointers
- [ ] Check return values
- [ ] Log security events
- [ ] Update tests

#### Static Analysis

Run before committing:

```bash
# C++ static analysis
cppcheck --enable=all --suppress=missingIncludeSystem src/

# Clang-tidy
clang-tidy src/*.cpp -- -Isrc -I/usr/include/obs

# Address Sanitizer (during development)
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DENABLE_ASAN=ON
```

#### Secure Coding Standards

Follow these principles:

1. **Validate Input**: All external data is untrusted
2. **Fail Secure**: Default to safe behavior on error
3. **Least Privilege**: Request minimal permissions
4. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security
5. **Logging**: Record security-relevant events

## üö® Reporting Vulnerabilities

### How to Report

**DO NOT** open public issues for security vulnerabilities!

Instead, please:

1. **Email**: Send details to the project maintainer (see GitHub profile)
2. **PGP**: Encrypt sensitive information (key in repository)
3. **Details**: Include:
   - Vulnerability description
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Proof of concept (if applicable)
   - Suggested fix (if available)

### What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 1 week
- **Fix Timeline**: Depends on severity
  - Critical: 7 days
  - High: 14 days
  - Medium: 30 days
  - Low: 90 days
- **Public Disclosure**: After fix is released

### Responsible Disclosure

We follow responsible disclosure:

1. Reporter notifies us privately
2. We work on a fix
3. Fix is released
4. Public disclosure (with credit to reporter)

### Bug Bounty

Currently, we do not offer a bug bounty program. However, we will:
- Credit security researchers in release notes
- List contributors in SECURITY.md
- Provide recognition in the project

## üìã Security Checklist
