## 📚 Documentation Guide

### For Users

Start here:
1. **README.md** - Quick start and overview
2. **MODELS.md** - Download and verify models
3. **SECURITY.md** - Understand security requirements

### For Developers

Read these:
1. **BUILDING.md** - Complete build instructions
2. **docs/ARCHITECTURE.md** - System design
3. **CONTRIBUTING.md** - Development guidelines
4. **docs/SECURITY_IMPLEMENTATION.md** - Security internals

### For Security Researchers

Check these:
1. **SECURITY.md** - Vulnerability reporting
2. **.github/SECURITY.md** - GitHub policy
3. **docs/SECURITY_IMPLEMENTATION.md** - Technical details

## 🗑️ Removed Files (Redundant)

- ~~QUICKSTART.md~~ → Consolidated into README.md
- ~~GETTING_STARTED.md~~ → Consolidated into README.md
- ~~PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md~~ → Moved to docs/ARCHITECTURE.md
- ~~BUILD_CACHOS.md~~ → Moved to docs/BUILD_CACHOS_DETAILED.md
- ~~SECURITY_IMPROVEMENTS.md~~ → Moved to docs/SECURITY_IMPLEMENTATION.md
- ~~SECURITY_SUMMARY.txt~~ → Redundant with SECURITY.md
- ~~.github_SECURITY.md~~ → Moved to .github/SECURITY.md

## ✅ Key Improvements

### Fixed Issues
- ✅ **Qt6 Support**: Changed all `qt5-base` → `qt6-base` (OBS 28.0+ requirement)
- ✅ **Added pkgconf**: Required for CMake to find OBS on Arch/CachyOS
- ✅ **Consolidated Docs**: Removed 6 redundant markdown files
- ✅ **Organized Structure**: Moved technical docs to `docs/` folder
- ✅ **GitHub Integration**: Proper `.github/` directory

### Updated Commands

**Before (Wrong):**
```bash
sudo pacman -S base-devel cmake git obs-studio opencv qt5-base
```

**After (Correct):**
```bash
sudo pacman -S base-devel cmake git pkgconf obs-studio opencv qt6-base openssl
```

**Changes:**
- `qt5-base` → `qt6-base` (OBS 28.0+ uses Qt6 since June 2023)
- Added `pkgconf` (provides pkg-config for CMake)
- Added `openssl` (for SHA-256 security features)

## 🎯 Quick Navigation

**Want to...**
- Build on CachyOS? → `README.md` (Quick Start)
- Build on other platforms? → `BUILDING.md`
- Understand security? → `SECURITY.md`
- Download models safely? → `MODELS.md`
- Contribute code? → `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- See what changed? → `CHANGELOG.md`
- Understand architecture? → `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- Report security issue? → `.github/SECURITY.md`

## 🔒 Security Files

All security-related documentation:
- `SECURITY.md` - Main security policy
- `MODELS.md` - Safe model usage (has security warnings)
- `docs/SECURITY_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Technical implementation
- `.github/SECURITY.md` - GitHub security tab
- `src/security-utils.{h,cpp}` - Security code

## 🚀 Build Commands (All Platforms)

### CachyOS/Arch (Corrected!)
```bash
sudo pacman -S base-devel cmake git pkgconf obs-studio opencv qt6-base openssl
# Note: pkgconf and qt6-base are REQUIRED!
```

### Ubuntu/Debian
```bash
sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake git pkg-config libobs-dev libopencv-dev qtbase5-dev libssl-dev
```

### macOS
```bash
brew install cmake opencv qt@6
```

## 📝 Notes

### Why the Changes?

1. **Qt6 Requirement**: OBS Studio 28.0+ dropped Qt5 support in June 2023
2. **pkgconf Missing**: Arch/CachyOS needs this for CMake to find libraries
3. **Too Many Docs**: Had 13 markdown files, consolidated to 8+3
4. **Better Organization**: Technical docs in `docs/`, GitHub stuff in `.github/`
5. **User-Focused**: README now has everything users need

### Compatibility

- ✅ OBS Studio 28.0+ (Qt6)
- ✅ CachyOS with optimized packages
- ✅ All Arch-based distributions
- ✅ Ubuntu/Debian (unchanged)
- ✅ macOS (unchanged)
- ✅ Windows (unchanged)
